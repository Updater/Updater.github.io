# Welcome to Updater's Awesome Collection of Style Guides

## Getting Started

To work on this style guide you'll need to have the following installed on your system:

* Node.js
* NPM
* Ruby
* Sass
* Compass
* Slim

Once you have those, clone this repo to your machine and run `npm install` to get started.

## Running Stuff

The work that was done before is all in the /old directory in this app. Check out the guides there for a starting point in writing your own.

Once you have everything installed, run `grunt build` from the root of the app to build all assets. If that runs without errors, run `grunt test` just to make sure everything is good.

If all the tests are green, you're good to go! Run `grunt serve`to get the server up and running. The watch task should run automatically when you change anything and if your changes didn't cause any errors, livereload will make those changes in your open browser tab.

Have fun coding!
