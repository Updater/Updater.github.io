If that runs without errors, run<code>grunt test</code>just to make sure everything is good.</p><p>If all the tests are green, you're good to go! Run<code>grunt serve</code>to get the server up and running. The watch task should run automatically when you change anything and if your changes didn't cause any errors, livereload will make those changes in your open browser tab.</p><p>Have fun coding!</p></div></div>
