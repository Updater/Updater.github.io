Try to stick to the following:</p><ul><li>Use 2 spaces for indentation.</li><li>Use 1 newline between chunks of code and 2 newlines between larger sections of code.</li><li>Keep your code DRY. If there's a section of code repeated, create a mixin for it and reduce code bloat.</li><li>Use block expansion when possible to keep your files shorter</li><li>When an element has many attributes separate them onto individual lines with no commas at the end.</li><li>Don't specify a value for attributes that are true or empty.</li><li>Avoid inlining plain HTML. Keep your code legible.</li><li>Keep as much logic as possible away from the Jade templates. Put it in a controller.</li><li>Only use unbuffered comments. HTML comments bloat the code that gets sent to the client.</li><li>Use Jade iterators in place of javascript in control code.</li></ul></div></div>
